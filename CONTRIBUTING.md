Thank you for taking the time to contribute to the Selerix BenSelect documentation.

## How can I contribute?

There are a variety of ways to contribute to the documentation, review the sections below to find out which one is right for you.

### Reporting Bugs and Suggesting Enhancements

Please use the GitHub "Issues" tab to submit bugs and suggestions.

### Editing in GitHub

Quick edits streamline the process to report and fix small errors and omissions in documents. Despite all efforts, small grammar and spelling errors do make their way into our published documents. While you can create issues to report mistakes, it's faster and easier to create a pull request (PR) to fix the issue, when the option is available.

### Pull Request

This workflow is suitable for a contributor who needs to make a major change or will be a frequent contributor to a repository. Frequent contributors typically have ongoing (long-running) changes, which go through multiple build/validation/staging cycles or span multiple days before pull request sign-off and merge.
